                Making a cookie is no easy task. We 
                shall figure out how to accomplish such 
                grueling task and escape unscathed. Firstly, 
                we should prepare the ingredients.

                <h2>Preparation part</h2>
                Do not fear. The hard part is behind us. Now that we have all the ingredients,
                let us prepare the cookie dough. Begin by working out the butter 
                together with flour and a bit of water. 
                Also add both of your sugars and salt (about 4 grains per nautical mile of dough).

                    Making the cookies:
                </h2>
                After finalizing your dough, split a small handfull from the 
                mother body and make up a cookie shape. Place it onto an oven tray and repeat until you 
                run out of dough or sanity. <br>Now that your dough is masterfuly split into individual cookies,
                put all of it together again and add in the chocolate chips your dumbass forgot to add. 
                Then repeat previous step.

                Finally, using your choice of cooking device, bake the cookies.
                The temperature and time depend on the current star alignement and your inner aura. I advise to
                meditate until the numbers are revealed to you.
